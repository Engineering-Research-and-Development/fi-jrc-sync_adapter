Unfortunately for many companies, especially SMEs, this question poses significant obstacles because they dont have the in-house expertise in photonics, or easy access to cutting-edge photonics technologies, to properly explore the innovation potential for their products. This is where ACTPHAST comes in. The ACTPHAST model is unique in a European context in that it is set up to provide a single entry point into a fully integrated prototyping supply chain across the broad spectrum of photonics technology platforms. ACTPHAST makes this cutting-edge photonics technology and expertise available in a subsidized format to any European company  with a particular emphasis on SMEs  for the purposes of collaborating on photonics innovation projects which will have a substantial impact on the companies business growth in terms of new revenues and job creation. The key point is that the companies are treated as valued customers of ACTPHAST to be provided with best-effort services and solutions in co-creation of new products, rather than simply providing the companies with advice or finance to deploy on their own. ACTPHAST meets the grand challenge of integrating all of the best research partners and photonics technology platforms into one cohesive Europe-wide access center with streamlined processes and procedures for collaboration with SMEs on rapid and effective product innovation. The core purpose of ACTPHAST is to identify and execute innovation projects aimed at addressing specific challenges in a companys new product development process using photonics, which if solved can result in accelerated time-to-market, revenue growth and new job creation. In delivering on this purpose, ACTPHAST is structured around 3 core activities as follows: 1. Outreach to companies to create awareness and generate expressions of interest from European industry in carrying out photonics innovation projects 2. Innovation support to companies to define and deliver challenging innovation projects between the ACTPHAST partners and the companies driven by their business needs 3. Coordination and Impact Measurement of activities to monitor performance against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and steer the programme of work to ensure that all objectives are met ACTPHAST is particularly geared towards rapid innovation projects of typically 7 months duration, purely driven by the business needs of the companies, with low administrative burden for the companies and up to 100% subsidy for SMEs (50% for large-scale companies), averaging out at just under 45K per project. ACTPHAST is, by design, focused on helping companies accelerate their product innovation from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 7 in order to achieve faster time-to-market. In short, ACTPHAST bridges the photonics expertise and technology gap for companies and takes a huge amount of the risk out of innovating with photonics by finding and mobilizing dedicated task forces made up of the right experts and technologies from amongst the ACTPHAST partners capabilities comprising of 7 state-of-the-art photonics technology platforms with full supply chains, and 150 experts fully trained and ready to support SMEs. ACTPHAST then funds the expert task forces to carry out innovation projects with the companies. In return, the companies have to demonstrate that they are fully committed to their project and have a strong probability of achieving a substantial impact on their revenue and jobs growth as a result."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Brussels Photonics B-PHOT, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050, Belgium","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Belgium","addressLocality":"Brussel"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Hugo","surname":"Thienpont","email":"hthienpo@vub.be","role":"Prof.","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Construction","Transport and logistics","Life sciences & healthcare","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of textiles and textile products","Manufacture of chemicals, chemical products and man-made fibres","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Manufacture of transport equipment"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:1248","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"ADAPT Centre"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://www.adaptcentre.ie/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"The ADAPT Research Centre focuses on developing next generation digital technologies that aim to enhance peoples lives by helping to analyse, personalise and deliver digital data more effectively for businesses and individuals."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"O&#39;Reilly Building, Trinity College Dublin","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Ireland","addressLocality":"Dublin"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Vincent","surname":"Wade","email":"vincent.wade@adaptcentre.ie","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Community, social and personal service activities"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:19407","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"AddedValue"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://www.addedvalueinstitution.com/?page_id=178"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"Added Value Economics Research and Development Institute Association is the coordinator of the AddedValue DIH.

Bearing in mind the global environment currently existing, the DIH has to have a double scope: on the one hand, it must be centred on the digitization of the agri-food businesses of Andalusia and, on the other hand, it must work to connect them to other businesses at national and European levels; it must promote the cooperation of actors at regional level, but it must also be a point to generate alliances between our regional initiatives and others beyond our regional borders.   a driver of change. Boosting the digitisation of the agri-food sector is a fundamental task, but not an end in itself. It is a powerful way to not only achieve the competitive improvement of the sector but also to obtain positive social and environmental impacts.******The Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) Andaluca Agrotech is an ecosystem created to help companies in the digitisation process of the agri-food sector with a non-profit character. This hub gathers the needs of the agri-food sector, technological services provided by ICT companies, the innovation capacity of knowledge agents and public programmes promoted by the public administration to provide support. The DIH Andaluca Agrotech has been designed to be an instrument to speed-up the implementation of digitisation in the agri-food value chain and to provide, in the first phase, the necessary training.This DIH Andaluca Agrotech is a centre of activity to create, anticipate and channel digital innovation in the agri-food sector, that provides the best conditions to enable sector companies achieve business success in the long-term.We can conclude in this respect that this DIH Andaluca Agrotech is a non-profit ecosystem with non-profit aims."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Tabladilla s/n","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Spain","addressLocality":"Sevilla"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Toro","surname":"Navero","email":"dih.andalucia.agrotech@juntadeandalucia.es","role":"de","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Maritime and fishery","Wholesale and retail","Transport and logistics","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:19600","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"API-K Lab"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://api-k.com/en/api-k-lab/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"Focused on supporting any opportunity that may raisesthe digitalization of the mountain areas, API-K Lab wants to contribute and enhance the initiatives of IoT and industrial partners at a regional, national and international level.In that perspective, API-K Lab is a part of API-K organization.

This is demonstrated through various advanced Horizon 2020 projects, such as, for example, the European Union - Republic of Korea project DECENTER (www.decenter-project.eu) that integrates technologies from the areas of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Edge, Fog and Cloud Computing, Digital Twins and Blockchains. There are a plethora of application domains for these technologies, including, among others, Smart Cities and Communities, Robotic Logistics, Smart Construction and Smart Homes, at the same time, these areas offer also opportunities to connect these technologies using of open data.In addition, there are many areas of application from the gaming and entertainment industry, education, cyber security and also financial technology systems.The convergence of the above mentioned technologies poses new challenges for the handling of transactions in highly dynamic and semantically complex ecosystems that involve heterogeneous resources and actors. Trustworthy data and knowledge management in such ecosystems is essential for the success of any industrial and business application. At a very high level, all smart applications require to address trust, security, safety, performance, dependability, quality of service and other high-level requirements.For some industrial players World-wide it may be obvious already for several years that blockchains as shared ledgers may play a pivotal role in addressing such requirements of smart applications. Even more so, what it is becoming apparent that what we now need to achieve is that this new technology is shaped in a way that allows the inclusion of valuable achievements of our European history including respect for human rights, security, privacy, diversity and pluralism. All these, sometimes conflicting requirements have to be addressed by upcoming Next Generation Internet technologies, and blockchains possess an enormous potential to contribute to these efforts. Great contribution can be achieved by increasing the use of open data from the public sector, which is aimed at connecting with various stakeholders in the information society, such as local governments (smart cities), the economy (data economy), science (open access), education institutions and non-governmental organizations (open innovation).For further reference, see for example, the foundational research and innovation activities of the ONTOCHAIN project (ontochain.ngi.eu) recently founded under the Horizon 2020 topic ICT-54 Blockchain for the Next Generation Internet, and two Interreg projects - ODEON - Open Data for European Open iNovation and DEAS - Data Economy Alps Strategy to stimulate participation, competitiveness and new business in Alpine SpaceWhile on one hand our progress in the domain of Blockchains is very fast, the general software industry on the other hand has no instruments in place to keep pace with these developments. This is where the proposed European Digital Innovation Hub Blockchain for Trustworthy and Open Data Ecosystems comes into play.Slovenia is already proven to have potential in the domain of Blockchains with both academic and commercial results, applications, technologies and services. However, our Slovenian and European industry still needs the proper transfer of know-how and knowledge in this domain to play an outstanding Global role. The core group of this EDIH believe there is a significant gap to be fulfilled between the State-of-the-Art in blockchains on one hand, which is already very advanced, and the current state of the broader industry on the other hand, which is in fact at the level of illiteracy, and even misconception.Slovenia is also at the very top in terms of openness of public sector data. The Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development (OECD) is in the publication Government at a Glance for 2019 ranked Slovenia at the very top in terms of openness of public sector data. Slovenia is ranked on 10th place in the world or 5th place among EU countries, just behind France, Ireland, Spain and Greece. Also the European Commission is in The Open Data Maturity Report for 2017 and 2018 ranked Slovenia 7th in the report for 2019 on the 10th place among the EU countries in the field of open public data sector.This elaboration is prepared in view of the possibility to join forces both internally in Slovenia as well as externally, with our European, International and Global partners in shaping a specific DIH that would cover core Blockchain technologies with particular focus on Cybersecurity, Data and Knowledge Infrastructure, in other words, on Trustworthy Data Ecosystems and in the same time, DIH will aslo promote synergies with between using the Open Data and blockchain technologies.BackgroundFollowing a longer entrepreneurial discovery process, Slovenia prepared its flagship S4 Smart Specialisation programme that is currently already well-known across Europe. The programme has eight vertical pillars: smart cities and communities, smart homes, sustainable tourism, sustainable materials, smart factories - factories of the future, smart mobility, circular economy, eHealth, and sustainable food chains.Originating from the Smart Specialisation programme are several DIHs, for example, in the area of High-Performance Computing, a domain with long lasting tradition in Europe due to the existence of various international projects, such as the Large-Hadron Collider.The idea of the Smart Specialisation programme has been to rely on what are seen as strengths of Slovenia, specific application domains, such as the development of smart wood chains (INNORENEW Centre of Excellence). Such developments may be used as a model for other European regions. Slovenia is a small Central-European country that pays a lot of respect for human-rights, the natural environment and sustainability. In a way, it represents the values of Europe and contributes to the European diversity. Open data, including statistical, spatial, and business datastatements in the fields of mobility, tourism, blue and green growth, and culture help us to make informed decisions and to build innovative services and we gain new insights into social affairs.On the other hand blockchains as we understand them today hold the ability to embody such principles in its core technology protocols and this is an area where we would like to contribute in the longer term.In the course of the past several years several activities have begun in Slovenia in a rather unorganised fashion. For example, there have been several pioneering companies, such as Hashnet that have developed their own ledger technologies. A well-known crypto exchange originating from Slovenia is Bitstamp as another example.In 2018 Slovenia signed the Blockchain Declaration of the European Commission and became part of the Blockchain partnership. In 2019 Slovenia contributed towards pilot services including the digital identity, diplomas and knowledge certification, notarisation and authentication on blockchain and some taxation related solutions.Slovenia was first European Member State adopting Action Plan on Blockchain, approved by the national government. Slovenia is also a member of European Blockchain Partnership and active participant at co-development and testing European Blockchain Services infrastructure (EBSI) with corresponding use cases. Slovenia is globally recognized as early mover in the development of Blockchain Technology.In the field of open data the national Open Data Portal - OPSI https://podatki.gov.si/ was established in 2016 as a single website for the publication of open data for the whole public sector.In March 2020, the Open Data Junction of Slovenia - OPSI HUB was established. The initiator of the establishment open data points are Tehnoloki Park Ljubljana d.o.o. (Odeon project) and the Chamber of Commerce of Slovenia, in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Administration.Slovenia&#39;s open data Hub will have focus on the integrated cooperation to promote and develop the opening of data and for the re-use of open data in order to develop the entrepreneurial, social and societal values offered by open data.The partners of this proposal have already a good map and understanding of the Slovenian landscape in Blockchain technologies and open data initiatives, and believe that specific focus on cybersecurity, data and knowledge management would appropriately position this DIH towards Slovenia&#39;s currently pressing needs for know-how and knowledge transfer.Current needsWith respect to the earlier discussion on the positioning of our DIH proposal, we have also taken into account several urgently needed activities that include:testing technological solutions for the national blockchain and open data infrastructure and further development of pilot applications;particular focus on interledger, cybersecurity, andtransfer of knowledge towards the smart specialization domains;the formation of Slovenians blockchain partnership;support for the operation of the open data Hub of Slovenia (OPSI HUB)development of support system for innovators in the blockchain domain in the areas of advanced blockchain technologies, funding mechanisms and regulatory framework;Establishment of financial mechanisms to promote entrepreneurial projects in the field of open datanetworking, bilateral and multilateral collaboration and contribution towards the international developments at European level and wider international context, such as activities under various bodies of the United Nations.improve the quality, quantity and scope of open data and related meta dataestablishment of the OPSI API moduleBased on these urgent needs in Slovenia, and the available academic and innovation capacities that can be structured in organized way we have set specific objectives that relate to the core technology area of blockchain and open data, and particularly focus on cybersecurity, data and knowledge infrastructure supported by blockchains.ObjectivesKey objectives of the Blockchain and open data DIH in Slovenia have been set as follows:Networking among the key players as support for the digital transformation, particularly in the domains of the smart specialization.Digesting and distilling the current state of development in the smart specialization domains in order to define the necessary digital competences and training in order to benefit from blockchain-based services.Expert services in blockchains, cybersecurity, data and knowledge infrastructures.Development of Minimum Viable Products and transfer of technologies to enterprises as many companies currently are not aware of the benefits of trustworthy data management with blockchains.Introduction of blockchain technologies in industrial and business processes.The use of blockchain related standards (e.g. protocols) to assure interoperability within the Single Digital MarketSupport in the search for investors, such as banks that have interests in the self-sovereign digital identity.The formation of testbeds involving several ledger technologies so that advanced application scenarios can be demonstrated to potential end-users. This may, for example, include Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and other technologies as well as advanced national ledger technologies, such as the technology portfolio of the Hashnet company, constituting national Blockchain infrastructure SI-Chain.Transfer of know-how within Slovenia and with European entities.Other collaborations with developers (e.g. IOTA foundation, EU Digital Observatory, Interledger etc.) and user groups.Promotional activities, for example, in the context of running national and international projects in which Slovenian and European partners are involved (e.g. ONTOCHAIN, DECENTER projects).Collaboration with the Government in the definition of a blockchain and open data related regulatory framework.Raising competitiveness in the post-quantum areas of blockchains and cybersecurity.Any other activities that contribute towards the digital transformation (e.g. ensuring higher levels of cybersecurity).promoting the use and dissemination of the OPSI portal and the opening of public data sector,encouraging the development of mechanisms for financing the use of open data,promoting the establishment and operation of a working group on open data Slovenia within the Digital Coalition,encouraging the participation of all stakeholders in the re-use of open data in fostering the active cooperation with international partners and hubs.Organization of various events (conferences, workshops, hackathons and others), in which all stakeholders will participate.Education and training for users and providers of open data.Technology areas coveredBearing in mind the convergence of today&#39;s technologies, a broad spectrum must be covered and aligned with the need of specific use cases. This includes:Internet of Things technologies that must rely on Blockchains in order to assure trustworthiness, traceability and transparency of the data produced.Artificial Intelligence technologies, such as deep learning methods that are nowadays containerised and orchestrated across administrative borders. Here, the focus is on the ethics of using Artificial Intelligence in specific contexts, the security and privacy of the data, as well as the higher operational semantics of Artificial Intelligence methods.Edge-Fog-Cloud computing poses new challenges towards the Quality of Service and the cybersecurity for streaming data on one side, and processing infrastructures on the other.Digital Twins may be closely related to the economics of blockchain based ecosystems, but there may be also other possibilities of using them in the context of blockchains.The use of all these core technologies in one scenario is best elaborated via DECENTERs cross-border data and AI model management scenario (for details, see https://www.decenter-project.eu/accomplishments/).Anticipated applicationsBased on our current assessments, the above mentioned technology types integrated with Blockchains have the potential to contribute to specific areas such as:Fintech, digital assets and smart grids,Digital society, identity and privacy,Digital economy, Data economy, SME&#39;s, industry and supply chains,Cybersecurity,IoT,eHealth, andFuture Internet, media and Big Data, among other.Slovenia has competencies in all of these areas and the proposed DIH may significantly contribute to improved competitiveness of Slovenian companies, if we corresponding activities will be implemented manage to seize the opportunity.CompetencesSlovenia has a unique blend of actors that enjoy international reputation in the Blockchain domain. These actors are intersted to provide their capacities and would immediately benefit from collaboration within the proposed DIH. In the following they are arranged according to the specific expertise covered:Academic organisationsThe University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science is currently involved in various activities including: (a) Scientific and Technical Coordination of the Next Generation Internet project ONTOCHAIN with 6 M EUR funding in the development of new software ecosystem for trusted, transparent and traceable ontological knowledge management; (b) research partner in the ongoing EU - Korean DECENTER project that develops a blockchain-enabled Fog Computing and Brokerage Platform along with partners from Korea such as LG-U+, Seoul National University, Korean Technology Institute and similar, (c) new Erasmus+ ESSA project that already focuses on the development of new curricula related to blockchains, (d) new university courses that include blockchains in the teaching activities, e.g. the course Fog Computing for Smart Services, (e) organisation of various international events such as the GECON conference series with events specifically focusing on blockchains, (f) the Digital Academy and other activities, (g) various blockchain testnets which are used in innovation and teaching activities.Software industryHashnet d.o.o. is a Slovenian distributed ledger technology infrastructure provider. They have developed the Hashnet DLT infrastructure using Proof-of-Stake with masternodes or Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithms. The team consists of seasoned technology experts, entrepreneurs, product specialists, and operational staff. Significant infrastructure developed by Hashnet: Tolar Hashnet mainnet - public blockchain network based on Tolar Hashnet platform, SI-Chain - National blockchain test infrastructure for Republic of Slovenia and Tolar Hashnet testnet - experimental public blockchain for testing/piloting new blockchain concepts.Business support organisationsTechnology Park Ljubljana d.o.o. is the oldest and largest technology park in Slovenia. It is an international technology hub where cutting-edge technologies meet, the best development companies meet and new technological stories are created. It has more than 300 members (companies) that come together in various technology communities. Technology park Ljubljana has established two laboratories. The first is the Smart and Digital Lab, dedicated to the development and testing of products in the fields of artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies, smart manufacturing, robotics, rapid prototyping, digital transformation, digital twins and Industry 4.0. The second is the VR / XR laboratory - an open innovation environment dedicated to the development of products and services in the field of augmented and virtual reality.OrganisationThe proposed European Digital Innovation Hub is organised as an open organisation, following similar governing structures of other DIH. Our EDIH welcomes the participation of Slovenian, European, International and Global entities in its structures. Slovenian and European Union legislation and guidance is closely observed in its operation.Financial schemaThe EDIH is organised as a non-for-profit organisation with a detailed sustainability plan. Bearing in mind the number of urgent activities specified above, the goal would be to look for win-win situations since day one. Hence, our intention is to form a sustainable ecosystem of participants. Various funding mechanisms would include (a) membership fees, (b) workshop fees, (c) services testing and development, (d) contributions in kind (e.g. towards the foreseen testbed) and similar.Link to national or regional initiatives for digitising industryThis is a proposal for a new European Digital Innovation Hub based on very recent developments in the domain of Blockchain in which Slovenia is one of the leading European Member States.Thisapproach is being considered among several stakeholders from academia, industry, supporting environment and community, together with the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology of the Republic of Slovenia.Ministry web site: https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/ministries/ministry-of-economic-development-and-technology/Contact point: M.Sc.

With our unique and valuable range of capabilities for Scotland combed with core knowledge and expertise built on the foundation of five years experience, we operate an effective partnership model, bringing together health and care practitioners, industry and academia to collaborate to solve key demand-led challenges.DHI is a non for-profit organisation fully funded by Scottish Government through the Scottish Funding Council and the NHS in Scotland. Tasked with addressing the current societal challenges facing health and care services through the use of digital tools and services it also makes an economic development contribution to Scotland and the wider UK by creating opportunities for SMEs and mid cap companies to develop, test and deploy solutions into the Scottish NHS as well as generating inward investment into Scotland. DHI is also a grant awarding body, allocating funding to academic institutions individually or in partnership with industry to take forward academic research and service evaluation as a way of encouraging and supporting innovation as well as creating a credible evidence base that can help secure a route to national and international markets for companies that it works with.The hub will focus on two main types of activity. The first is simulation. DHI will provide data sharing infrastructure that is integrated into health board, local government and third sector care delivery systems. This will allow participating SMEs to connect to this infrastructure and show their products working within a functioning ecosystem  e.g. being able to upload monitoring data or download clinical record data. Individual simulations will be run with DHI developing dummy data based test users that can be used to show how integrated systems work together for real, building confidence in the SME product by showing it working in tandem with health systems and other suppliers. When a simulation is successful, DHI will help the SMEs to attract further funding, using the simulation as proof of concept and route to market to improve the hit rate for funding bids.The second is demonstration. A design, engagement and project management team will showcase services and products provided by SMEs in a Glasgow based showroom. The team will work with SMEs to create co-designed user stories about seamless and integrated digital service delivery and its benefits. In many cases parts of this story will be simulated as per the above section, to help build confidence in the feasibility and route to market. This material will be used with DHIs partners across public services, academia and industry  to help people form consortia to seek further funding or to take products into trial or operation. As DHI regularly demonstrates these outputs, they will gather feedback and use this to inform and progress SME capabilities  both technical and commercial, while also influencing commissioners to specify digital services that align with these capabilities."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"1st Floor, Suite B, Inovo Building, 121 George Street, Glasgow","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"United Kingdom","addressLocality":"Glasgow"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Kara","surname":"Mackenzie","email":"kara.mackenzie@dhi-scotland.com","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Life sciences & healthcare"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:23691","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Digital Health-Biosciences (DIHbio)"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://www.knode.eu/en/dihbio"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"DIHbio (Digital Health &amp; Biosciences) is a non-profit consortium that works for the benefit of the country, promoting strategic areas with a high capacity to transform and impact peoples lives, such as biotechnology, life sciences and digital technologies.

After its creation, the DIH benefited from the co-financing of the European Commission through DIHELP.Smart eHUBmission is to providedigital services to private sector companies, in particular, but also to public sector, able to offer the best expertise and skills in technologies needed for digital transformation, such as: Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS), Design for Manufacturing (DFM), Digital Services Outsourcing, data processing, IoT, IIoT, Industry 4.0, M2M, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, cloud computing, laser technologies, 3D printing, blockchain, systems of spatial or geographical information and others.Smart eHUB founding members are three non-governmental/ non-for-profit organisations:APTE - ELINCLUS Cluster,University Entrepreneurial CenterUSH ProBusiness andSmart Alliance Innovation Technology Cluster(all 3 are the DIH founding members and coordinators).The Smart eHUB Consortium includes also a series of regional and national organisations, such as:Regional Development Agency Bucharest Ilfov, Regional Development Agency South-Muntenia, University POLITEHNICA Bucharest,ROMANIAN ASSOCIATION FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS,Association for Promoting Electronics Technology, CETTI,Clustero - representative body of clusters, PROSME,National Union of Employers in Romania, IND-AGRO-POL Cluster, Magurele Science Park, etc.Smart eHubaddresses regional digitisation issues by providing SMEs one-stop-shop for tailor made digitalization services in their regional proximity.The coordinatorsoffer at their best the suitable capacity and competences to provide digitalisationservicesto the regional ecosystemwhich do not have a clear perception of digitalisationbenefits. In this static environment, lagging behind European countries,Smart eHubcomes as a cost-effective and high scaling solution which help companies to be more open towards digitization.The three partners have a rich experience in organizing the know-how and technology transfer activities and benefit from the interaction between business and the academic environment, as follows:1. APTE-ELINCLUS - Electronic Innovation Clusteris a cluster whose industrial composition is represented by SME companies involved in the development of electronic products for various fields, such as: telecommunication, intelligent systems, automation, monitoring and control, high precision measurements, and so on.ELINCLUS Cluster has been formed starting from the structure of economic relationships existing betweenCETTI(Center for Electronic Technology and Interconnection Techniques), who has developed a Technological and Business Incubator, entity accredited in National Innovation and Technology Transfer Network ReNITT and companies from the Bucureti-Ilfov region, by associating with Bucharest-Ilfov Regional Development Agency, ARIES and APTE. The Association for Promoting Electronic Technology - APTE realised several surveys, studies, strategies and policy papers to support the innovation process and culture for the electronic and software industry of Romania. For its activity APTE has received the Silver Label from ESCA (The European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis) since 2016. APTE is member of the Romanian Cluster Association CLUSTERO, being in the managing board of the association and being actively involved in the annual organization of the National Cluster Conference.APTE received since 2015 the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification for Quality Management System. The evaluation was done by TV (Technische berwachung Hessen GmbH), an international certification body.To be continuously in contact with the newest standards regarding electronic industry worldwide, APTE became in 2014 an IPC member (Association Connecting Electronics Industry). The contact with IPC allowed, by receiving the needed information, to build up a professional education and training environment, strong support for creating a proper human resource, mandatory to enhance the competitiveness of the electronic industry in the European Union.2. USH Pro Businesshas a unique position in the region and nationwide, as a university entrepreneurial centre. USH ProBusiness experience and the permanent connection with both the academic environment and the business environment allows for the optimal connection of scientific and academic resources to those of the business environment, as we find that the biggest problem for putting in the value of Romania&#39;s immense potential in the innovation area is market cooperation between the scientific resource (researchers) and entrepreneurs. USH ProBusiness has actively contributed to the creation, development and promotion of clusters:BIO DANUBIUS,BIO CONCEPT PRAHOVA VALLEY,CERMAND (Renewable Energy Center on the Black Sea and Danube), DANUBE ENGINEERING HUB and CREATIVE BUCHAREST.3.Smart Alliance Cluster(Bronze label, Cluster Management Excellence) addresses innovation and digitalization issues through various initiatives, partnerships and eventsdirected towards the SME ICT sector and through the Smart Alliance Innovation Summit, an annual event, that brings together a continuously increasing number (+500) of C-level business peopleThe goal of Smart eHUB partners is to create a platform of networking and connectivity between successful SMEs, leaders in the Romanian ICT landscape and companies that need to become more competitive and innovative through digitalisation.The smart specialization in the region is still a policy target (in 2019), designed at the top, not yet fully understood by the SMEs sector. Through DIH we act as a catalyzer of a better entrepreneurial specialization process in the region. Pursuing an assessment and selection process in the strategy,six sectors ofsmart specializationthat have the highest potential for innovation and developmenthave been selected. Each sector may be capitalized through multiple economic, technologic and scientific activities:Agriculture and food industry: with emphasis on traditional bio products; Bioeconomy, Biomedicine and precision farming (GIS services, large data processing and imaging)Tourism and cultural identity: there is a huge potential for management and information management for integration of tourist offers on Curtea de Arge  Cmpulung  Rucr  Dmbovia  Bran Bridge in a regional value chainSmart Cities: Information management and management technology, computing and imaging; Production of solar panels; Urban Mobility Plans; Waste management plans.Wood Processing &amp; Furniture: Production&amp; Implementation of assistive technologies for production processes, quality &amp; designTextile and apparelAutomotive: Production of automotive subassemblies; Production of wiring; Engineering and related technical consultancy activities, research development in other natural sciences and engineering.The DIHs objectives(similar toCoordinatorsobjectives)are fully aligned to the smart specialization areas of the region, considering the existing ecosystem of innovation such as university education infrastructure of Polytechnic University/ Electronic Faculty, Spiru Haret University, knowledge transfer centers of USH Probusiness(located in Bucharest, Ploiesti, Craiova, Constanta, Brasov, Campulung),ICT competencies and expertise in software development of Smart Alliance members, and ELINCLUS Cluster.Smart eHub strategy is focused in strengthening the innovation ecosystem, creating and implementing regional strategies in order to promote digitalization and smart specialization.All coordinating partners are focused on ICT based creative industries:- The USH ProBusiness has experience in providing business services, and developing an innovative ecosystem. The center&#39;s activity is aimed at entrepreneurial development services for facilitating the market access of its clients. It was authorized for creative industries through the Order of the Minister of Research and Innovation no.150 / 15.03.2017.- Production, distribution, utilities, financial services, telecommunications, public administration, education or human resources are just a small part of the economical, administrative and educational areas that Smart Alliance Cluster covers with IT products and services.- ELINCLUS Cluster hasexperience in supporting companies active in the field of electronics, sensors, ICT, applied mainly to automotive IoT space, mechatronics, precision agriculture, telecommunications for the entire innovation projects lifecycle.In February 2019 Smart eHUB was selected by DIHELP Academy to be part of their coaching and mentoringprogramme.The main targets of Smart eHUB are:SMEs in the South Muntenia &amp; Bucharest region - with 56,908 SMEs in South Muntenia and 131,334 SMEs in Bucharest-Ilfov, out of which to focus on innovative Start-ups (that lack resources for digitalisation) and SMEs which have issues to scaleup their business. The SME sector in target is split following smart specialisation domains: Agriculture &amp; Food processing, Furniture &amp; wood processing, Textile &amp; apparel, etc. At the same group are targeted cluster managers which can act as brokers to reach the companies inside their clusters.Researchers and innovators, including individuals, young PhD students, academics, students, Start-uppers, SMEs, and industry players actively engaged in research and innovation initiatives that are of direct relevance to define, strengthen and shape the R&amp;D agenda for the DIH and grow the DIH ecosystem.The secondary target:Tech ventures and financial business accelerators, business angels and business incubatorsLocal authorities/ Public Administration bodies, Policy-makers: the various public and private authorities and policy-makers committed to the DIH by supporting the development of its initiatives, fostering research, development and innovation that shall have a positive impact for the regional/ national society.Regional/ National &amp; EU representatives and entities, involved in DIHs assessment and evaluation  to be further identified and defined this segmentTechnology providers/ developers/ large companies that could offer new technologies, solutions, testbeds and mechanisms to complement, extend and/or build on top of existing DIH facilities.

Flanders FOOD will thereby mainly act as an enabler for innovation, and an integrator to create a trust zone of open innovation with all stakeholders in the agri-food business complex. The three economic drivers for growth are: (1) increasing local and international competitiveness, (2) focus on new business opportunities through system integration and (3) take up the social and societal responsibilities. To provide an answer to these three economic drivers, four strategic objectives are defined (Lead in knowledge, Lead to knowledge, Accelerate efficient &amp; effective innovation and Create/cross value chains). They should increase knowledge and broaden the horizons of companies on one hand, and on the other enable them to validate and implement this new knowledge into new products, processes and concepts that drive their economic growth. Flanders FOOD is not defining the products, processes and services of the future, but will create enablers for companies to act quicker, better and more efficient in their innovation processes. The knowledge-driven strategic goals focus on three program lines: (1) World Class Food Production, (2) Resilient &amp; Sustainable Agri-food Systems and (3) Personalized Food Products &amp; Healthy Diets. A number of activities contribute to the realization of the strategic goals, such as: Development of dedicated roadmaps, creation of a (virtual) inspiration center, education of the target group, distribution of information beyond the target group, establishment of a scientific and technological advisory network, enable access to pilot infrastructure, support in workplace innovation, support in research implementation, guidance towards co-creation and co-development Flanders FOOD, in collaboration with the Institute for agricultural and fisheries research (ILVO), has set up a Food Pilot, this is a pilot plant filled with industrial process lines on a pilot scale, accessible to food companies for testing. Pilot tests on a semi-industrial scale allow companies to try out new concepts, processes and products. The past 5 years, the Food Pilot has become an important service provider with an integrated approach to collaborate with companies. Companies from various sectors found their way to the Food Pilot. (Website: http://www.foodpilot.be/en/) Flanders FOOD counts 310 member companies in 2017, spread over the ecosystem of the food industry: about two thirds of the members are companies in food production and ingredient suppliers, the other members are companies in machinery and technology, feed and retail. All cluster members, beingall actors in the triple helix including research and technology organizations (RTOs), other cluster organizations and innovation actors work together to achieve common goals, as defined in the strategic objectives, but also make sure each partner involved benefits from these collaborations. Different types of stakeholders have different roles in the strategy and are more involved in some strategic domains than others. Flanders FOOD is leading partner for a smart specialization platform Agri-food http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/smart-electronic-systems To collaborate internationally Flanders FOOD is associated partner in several ERANETs (Cofund Facce Surplus, Susfood II and Marine Biotech) and interreg projects. The Food Pilot is European wide interesting for other SMEs. Today several customers from abroad already found their way to the pilot plant. The facilities are open for all EU companies at the same conditions as for Flemish companies."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Wetenschapsstraat 14a","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Belgium","addressLocality":"Brussels"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Veerle","surname":"Rijckaert","email":"Veerle.rijckaert@flandersfood.com","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Wholesale and retail","Tourism (incl. restaurants and hospitality)","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of machinery and equipment"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:22492","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Flanders Make vzw"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://www.flandersmake.be"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"Flanders Make is the strategic research centre for the manufacturing industry.

The DIH represents a partnership formed by different entities from the non-profit, public, private, but also from the academic field, all serving the same common goal: to develop and implement a complex process in order to facilitate the digital transformation of SMEs, organizations and public administrations in the Central Region of Romania, with the purpose of increasing the economic, social and administrative competitiveness of the region at European level.The non-profit objective of FIT DIH is important in this regard and could encourage local companies to improve the overall impact of the local economy. When it is possible not to find the right local partners, the digital innovation hub can connect to the network with other DIHs to find a partner that fits elsewhere in Europe.A true catalyst for innovation and digitalization, covering a wide range of services, FIT aligns with the four main types of services specific to a DIH. Through these, the hub brings together the entire ecosystem under a common mission, that of accelerated progress towards digitalization and the adoption of emerging technologies, serving both companies with tradition and start-ups and innovators.Our hub&#39;s activities towards supporting the local SMEs with their digital transformation are the following:The Test before invest component aims to raise awareness and ensure access to expertise, know-how and digital transformation services, including testing and experimentation facilities.A living lab is a research concept that can be defined as an open, iterative and user-centered innovation ecosystem, operated at the territorial level (Central Region), integrating research, development and innovation processes in a public-private-people partnership. An excellent way to identify and solve the problems facing society, the living lab allows innovators access to real data and the ability to test proposed solutions in a real-world setting. The smart specialization areas for which we develop the living lab infrastructure are Industry 4.0 and E-health.Digital competencesThrough training, coaching and e-learning programs, we accelerate the rate of adoption of advanced digital skills among SMEs in the Central Region of Romania. In addition to educational programs, a special contribution is the package of modular microservices for the digitalization of companies - FIT Digital Booster. Through modularity and replicability, microservices can be adapted to all industries. The first initiatives in this direction are addressed to SMEs in the fields of Health and HORECA.Access to investments and financingInnovation, good ideas and steps forward need resources. Therefore, the FIT Digital Innovation Hub provides support for companies, especially SMEs and start-ups, through services such as: access to financial institutions and investors, supporting the use of InvestEU and other relevant financing mechanisms. As a pilot initiative, we are developing a disruptive start-up identification service to be introduced in an extensive mentoring, acceleration and funding process. In support of SMEs, we are preparing a simplified digital application methodology for public funding.The DIHs partners aim to capitalize on existing skills in digital technologies (such asAI, Big Data, AR / VR, robotics, IoT) but also in the emerging ones (Blockchain, 5G, CPS, HPC, cybersecurity) in order to meet the needs of 4 key application areas: 1. Smart cities &amp; digital administration; 2. Industry 4.0 and digitalization industry; 3. E-health and 4. Tourism 4.0.By implementing good practices regarding the management of Digital Innovation Centers transferred through the participation of the FIT team in the technical assistance projects Smart Factories in New EU Member States and DIHELP, but also by implementing the conclusions drawn from the pilot project dedicated to DIHs - DigitaliseSME, we aim to sustainably develop a series of value chains of digital transformation at the level of the region involving the centers of competence, consultants and designers, technology suppliers and integrators, innovators and startups, beneficiaries and users.Expertise in digital technologies with which Futures of Innovation and Technology Digital Innovation Hub will operate is owned on the one hand by the University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology &#34;George Emil Palade&#34; in Targu Mures, and on the other hand by the Cluster for Innovation and Technology, among its members are Transilvania University of Brasov and more than 40 technology companies active in the Central Region.The Futures of Innovation and Technology Digital Innovation Hub is taking part, either directly or through founding partners, of a series of European DIH networks, such as: AgROBOfood, DIH World, DigitaliseSME or DIHNET.eu."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Memorandumului Street, 41","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Romania","addressLocality":"Brasov"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Ionut","surname":"Tata","email":"ionut.tata@iceberg.plus","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Energy and utilities","Construction","Wholesale and retail","Tourism (incl. restaurants and hospitality)","Transport and logistics","Public administration","Education","Life sciences & healthcare","Manufacture of wood and wood products","Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal products","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Financial services"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:1517","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"FZI Research Center for Information Technology"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://www.fzi.de/en/home/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"The FZI Research Center for Information Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is a non-profit institution for applied research in information technology and technology transfer.

Following the launch of the Global Alliance for Media Innovation during WAN-IFRAs World Congress in June 2014, we have established a brain trust of stakeholders involved in research and innovation for news media. The core of this group is composed of pioneers, media organisations (publishers and suppliers), and academic research labs dealing with technology transfer and research programmes in Europe (Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, UK), the Americas (Brazil, USA, Canada), and Southeast Asia (Singapore, Japan). The Alliance was formed because its members all believe that our industry requires a reliable flood of new technologies, products and business models. We see the future of news media being invented right now, all around the globe, by hundreds of different companies, universities and entrepreneurs. But their separate efforts, research, prototypes and rollouts receive inconsistent attention and analysis. Many good ideas fail simply due to a lack of development support, while others get hyped beyond their real value. Vital lessons and examples are not being widely enough or rapidly enough disseminated. GAMI focuses on five main topic areas relevant to the future of news media companies, news professionals, and news consumers: New platforms/distribution channels: mobility, wear-ability, the Internet of Things (smart cities, connected homes, connected cars, connected devices); New forms of narrative and storytelling: immersive content, VR, 360 video, social media; Data exploration: big data, data visualisation, automatic generation of content; Technology enablers: privacy, security; Multiple media convergence: interoperability, standards (IPTC, etc.) GAMI is guided by an Advisory Board representing news media or media labs, suppliers, research centres, universities, technology clusters and accelerators."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"72 rue d&#39;Hauteville","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"France","addressLocality":"Paris"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Stephen","surname":"Fozard","email":"stephen.fozard@wan-ifra.org","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Community, social and personal service activities"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:24191","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Globus 2020 S.r.l."},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://www.globus2020.com"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"DIH Casartigiani is a non-profit initiative that carries out networking, matchmaking, brokerage and dissemination activities.DIH Casartigiani&#39;s goal is to help companies become more competitive by improving their business/production processes as well as products and services through digital technology.DIH deals with the promotion of the transformation of digital production towards the Industry 4.0 approach and the processes of the value chain in general.In particular, the main activities are:- Dissemination of awareness (meeting, workshop, etc.)- Support activities to industrial companies for the implementation of projects based on Industry 4.0 - Support access to the tax benefits provided by the Industry 4.0 Plan Support activities for the assessment of digital readiness- Support activities to facilitate the access of manufacturing companies to the regional innovation ecosystem Design and delivery of training initiatives Coordination activities for the implementation of I4.0 - based establishments.Casartigiani is an Italian Social Party, which represents approximately 200,000 SMEs, it has 18 regional federations and 119 provincial offices.Casartigiani has established the spinout Globus 2020 S.r.l. with the aim of creating a collaborative community, a bioecosystem focused on digital technologies and new business models capable of improving the competitiveness of companies, directing them to Partners who can help them during the digital transformation process.Globus 2020 S.r.l. it is also a Research Organization (OdR), Social Incubator Accelerator (SIA) and Developer of an AIF of Ventur Debt, in collaboration with P&amp;G SGR SpA.Among other things, Globus 2020 S.r.l. has expressed to Invitalia the will to sign a Protocoll fot the support of Innovative SMEs.DIH Casartigiani will open a local unit c/o each of the 18 Regional Federations Casartigiani.The DIH Casartigiani has been recognized by the MISE (Ministry for Economic Development) in Italy as an emanation of a Social Part (the Casartigiani), in fact it is published on the Atlante i4.0 portal.The activity of DIH Casartigiani is aimed at supporting SMEs for their digital transformation on the Italian territory, and is a non-profit activity.In fact, the DIH Casartigiani is an integral part of Casartigiani Benefit Network (Casartigiani BNet), which aims to support SMEs with impact activities, or with social and occupational repercussions, as well as respectful of the environment.There are three values of the action of Casartigiani:- reduction of the citizenship gap;- gender equality;- young people.DIH Casartigiani carries out the following activities and services:- training courses;- experimental research and development projects;- business incubation;- orientation and networking;- assistance on 4.0 business processes and / or models;- assistance on 4.0 technologies;- digital evaluation;- prototyping;- demonstration activity;- dissemination of knowledge on 4.0 technologies.The technologies that the Casartigiani DIH follows are:- Cybersecurity;- Big data and Analytics;- Cloud services;- Internet of things;- Vertical and Horizontal Integration;- Additive Manufacturing;- Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality;- Simulation;- Artificial intelligence;- DLT and Blockchain;- Advanced Manufacturing;- Other Technologies."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Via G.

Until today we have hosted more than 700 events on a yearly rate.We have all advantages of modern technology (fastest internet links, 3D printers, security cameras coverage, beamers and sound equipment), but we also have a cozy look, old style couches and armchairs, warm colors, wooden desks and we created a home for our residents and guests.Being different than regular office rentals offers on the Croatian market today - HUB385 coworking space created an immediate buzz on the market. A desk in the coworking area can be in fully open space, or shared offices, while it is also possible to rent individual (closed) offices - rented per number of seats.Shared space, whether it is office space, open areas, lounges, meeting rooms or kitchens, inspires our tenants and guests to share knowledge, to help each other with problems, to create teams that would have never happen,to become inventors, developers, founders or marketers.HUB385 is an open platform, where everyone is inspired and where ideas flow freely.Our residents represent a big part of Croatian young entrepreneurial scene, they are new role models, they are those whom we have to help survive and fight and be recognized at home, in Croatia. Many of them have proven their knowledge and skills by already succeeding on other markets - but they still see benefits of staying home.HUB385 Academy offers everything from leadership skills to financial plans, from robotics to Internet of Things, from communication management to specific start-up knowledge...HUB385 Academy is a learning platform, where through workshops, mentorships and seminars - by international or local educators - everyone can pick and choose which area is of their interest.At the same time, events are taking place in numerous locations offered by HUB385, they vary by number and origin of guests, by organizers or budgets. The choice of multiple breakout rooms and venues inside the same building, while keeping the relaxed atmosphere - makes HUB385 a home for intercompany workshops, parallel program educations and strategy meetings for companies in ICT sector and beyond.Different gatherings, press conferences, events - often combined with catering in the lobby - make our event space always full of people, place to meet and be met, to see and be seen, but we keep the working mode and content as a priority.Besides conferences such as Brave New World, HUB385 organizes power breakfasts, debate clubs, tailor made events, public debates and a lot more.Finally, HUB385 is a private and independent initiative, created, managed and owned by a team of founders (Mudrinic, Soljan, Magzan). The total investment in 2016 (infrastructure, equipment, plus initial operational costs - organization, promotion) was around 1 million EUR. HUB385 group is committed to stay non-profit, whereby any profit that comes from sponsorships, coworking space, HUB385 Academy or events - stays in HUB for further growth and development. HUB385 is also a platform to innovate and develop new products, to collaborate with best tech experts, to open new workplaces and help local companies enter other markets.The team behind HUB385 has years and years of experience in various fields from corporate strategy, business consulting, telecommunications especially as part of the Deutsche Telecom group (Senior VP od Deutsche Telecom*, IT &amp; ICT industry (CEO and board member positions), incorporation of new technology in day-to-day business, digital transformation (several companies), press and media, educational development, brand building and graphic design. The positions that the team held vary from CEOs, C-level management, head of the National competitiveness council, Heads of the Croatian Employers Association, councils to key state players and other politically and economically influential positions and much more."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Petraieva 4","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Croatia","addressLocality":"Zagreb"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Diana","surname":"Mudrinic","email":"diana@hub385.com","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Wholesale and retail","Transport and logistics","Public administration","Education","Life sciences & healthcare","Community, social and personal service activities","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Financial services"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:5563","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"HUB387"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://www.hub387.com/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"HUB387s mission is to build a vibrant IT community, a space where aspiring IT companies and individuals will connect and collaborate; where interaction with peers will facilitate new ideas and solutions to challenges in our workplace.

Key themes are application of AR and VR in guided operations,guided maintenance, VR training and digital twins together with machine learning, AI, Big Data and sensors.The 4th Industrial Revolution deals with far-reaching flexibility, robotization and automation. Many companies share the vision: &#34;24 hours a day full automated and error-free production, based on customer questions.&#34; But that also raises many questions about the impact on employment. Do you as a company focus on technology or human beings? Due to more flexibility in production, coupled with shorter turnaround times and the desire for error-free production, companies are opposed to the limited information processing capacity of humans. The IR Hub therefore focuses on the development of technological solutions for improving the interaction between human and machine.ActivitiesThe companies that collaborate within the IR Hub are active in three working groupsKnowledge - development of technology roadmapsProjects- Development of international cooperation and innovation projectsInternationalisation and Exposure  connecting the Hub on the European level to partners and other Hubs."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Laan van Malkenschoten, 40","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Netherlands","addressLocality":"Apeldoorn"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Jan","surname":"Kooij","email":"robbertjan.kooij@oostnl.nl","role":"Robbert","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Construction","Transport and logistics","Public administration","Life sciences & healthcare","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of pulp, paper and paper products; publishing and printing","Manufacture of chemicals, chemical products and man-made fibres","Manufacture of rubber and plastic products","Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal products","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Manufacture of transport equipment","Other Manufacturing"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:5828","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Industrial Ring"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://anellaindustrial.cat"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"The Industrial Ring brings together engineers, manufacturers (OEM and TIER1), technology providers, associations, research centers, universities and government with the aim to identify, develop and promote best practices around 4.0 Industry or Industrial Internet.

Its research activities focus on service robotics, remote handling and collaborative robotics, with applications in the fields of energy (nuclear, oil&amp;gaz), industry and health (surgery and rehabilitation). Robotics research at CEA initially started in the 1960s and 1970s to address the need of remote manipulation of nuclear material in environments non accessible to humans. Force feedback telerobotics is now also used in other hazardous environments like tunnel boring, space or offshore. In the industrial context, the research performed at CEA anticipates and accompanies the current evolution of production from large scale manufacturing of standard items to customized and individualized products. This evolution requires the development of more dextrous and easily programmable robots which can be used as versatile, reconfigurable and intelligent means of production. On the other hand, collaborative robotics in permanent interaction with humans offers another solution. By providing a force and gesture assistance to the operators, collaborative robots allow to minimize musculoskeletal disorders caused by manual tasks while maintaining human flexibility and adaptability. The Interactive Robotics Laboratory also works on future service robotics, with focus on personal assistance requiring more dexterity, mobility and autonomy (intelligent systems). Finally, the force feedback, haptics and cobotics technologies developed in the laboratory are applied in surgery and rehabilitation. The laboratory is structured to provide technological innovation integrated into industrial prototypes. Core technologies are new robotic architectures, high performance actuation, force and supervised control, method and software tools. Research activity is organised in 3 main applicative themes: remote handling, collaborative robotics and autonomous dextrous manipulation."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"CEA SACLAY DIGITEO LABS, Btiment 660","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"France","addressLocality":"GIF-SUR-YVETTE"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Yann","surname":"Perrot","email":"yann.perrot@cea.fr","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Energy and utilities","Construction","Transport and logistics","Life sciences & healthcare","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of textiles and textile products","Manufacture of leather and leather products","Manufacture of wood and wood products","Manufacture of pulp, paper and paper products; publishing and printing","Manufacture of coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel","Manufacture of chemicals, chemical products and man-made fibres","Manufacture of rubber and plastic products","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products","Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal products","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Manufacture of transport equipment","Other Manufacturing"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:4949","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"International Advanced Manufacturing 3D Hub (IAM 3D HUB)"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://www.iam3dhub.org"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"The IAM 3D HUB is a networked organization without formal structure and non-profit purposes.

IIT has produced more than 8500 publications and 211 inventions resulting in more than 500 patent applications. Its research activity led to the creation of 17 spin-offs, with additional 26 under due diligence. Research is carried out in the Central Research laboratory in Genoa (IIT headquarters), in 11 research satellite centers across Italy and in 2 outstations in US. IIT scientific vision is interdisciplinary, based on the concept of translating evolution into technology, that is mimicking natural solutions to develop new technologies in the fields of robotics, materials science, and life science. Currently IIT is conducting its new scientific plan (2018-2023) developing four strategic research domains: Robotics, Nanomaterials, Technologies for Life Science, and Computational Sciences. The main goal is to produce technologies that will have a positive impact on some important societal challenges, such as sustainability and the environment, healthcare and aging society, also reflecting the priorities of EU framework programs. This approach promotes the creation of joint-labs and research agreements with industrial partners, universities, and international research centersIIT develops research and technology in the fields of IT with a special focus on robotics and artificial intelligence. One of the main application targets of IITs technologies is in the health care domain. Our results in robotics are constantly translated into rehabilitation devices, prostheses, exoskeletons or smart surgical systems. Robots are also being developed as general-purpose assistants for the elderly or people with special needs. Artificial intelligence impacts on the one hand on the level of autonomy of the robots, on the other in the most disparate applications such as genetic data analysis, modeling for digital twins, and cyber security, to name a few. Concrete results and demonstrators can be observed in a number of IIT laboratories including the Joint Laboratory with INAIL (main workers insurance in Italy) for the rehabilitation technologies, the assistive robotics laboratories (iCub Facility) including joint work with the Fondazione Don Gnocchi (hospital) and IBM in various applications for health care, and the surgical robotics laboratory jointly developed with the IRCCS San Martino in Genoa."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"via Morego 30","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Italy","addressLocality":"Genova"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Projects","surname":"Office","email":"dih@proposal.iit.it","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":[]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:17471","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"ITI Data Hub (The Data Cycle Hub)"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://thedatacyclehub.com/en/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"The mission of the Data Cycle Hub is to be a reference one-stop shop DIH in the Valencia region to foster data driven and artificial intelligence based innovation.

DMBIUBIH is a community of stakeholders in the field of medical and biological engineering and information exchange platform, working for the benefit of health sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina. DMBIUBIH has more than 80 active members and this number is constantly increasing. The members of the society are university professors, doctors, engineers and technicians in the field of medicine and engineering, as well as students, young people interested in this field. Since 2015, DMBIUBIH has been a member of the International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineering (IFMBE), and since 2017 it has been a member of the European Alliance for Medical and Biological Engineering and Science (EAMBES). DMBIUBIHs vision is to become a national platform for cooperation and professional development of all interested stakeholders in the field of medical and biological engineering in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its mission is to support the scientific development, digitalization and establishment of sustainable communication between industry, science and the public in the field of medical and biological engineering in Bosnia and Herzegovina. DMBIUBIH has organized international conferences, regional workshops, study visits, trainings and education for researchers and students. It has participated in various projects funded by the European Union, such as the European program TAIEX in the fields of biomedical signals, renewable energy sources, biosensors, nanotechnology, genetics and medical physics.Platform for Digital Transformation - LabHubLabHub is a platform for digital transformation in the medical and biological engineering sectors. The services provided by LabHub are non-profit. The platform was established by the Bosnia and Herzegovina Medical and Biological Engineering Society (DMBIUBIH) with the aim of supporting the development and digitalization of health sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The LabHub platform program aims to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), laboratories and start-ups in their digital transformation in the biomedical engineering sector. Laboratories (testing, inspection, certification) are in focus because they represent an information hub where the population submits information to the system, laboratories create databases and report to competent authorities, competent and scientific organizations monitor the movement of database parameters and health and other institutions actively use this data. However, in a large number of cases, this kind of work is not automated or digitalized. An additional problem in this area is a lack of support for researchers and PhD students, as well as support for entrepreneurs to start new businesses in this demanding field. DMBIUBIH wants to transfer the acquired knowledge and experience through the LabHub platform because it has become a regional leader in the field of biomedical engineering. Together with the publisher Springer, it has organized the International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering (CMBEBIH).DMBIUBIH Success storyVerlab d.o.o. Sarajevo is a successful middle-sized company registered in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was established by young university professors and engineers. This company has been created as a result of their research and development action in the field of DMBIBIH domain. It is a very rare example in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where business ideas are originating from sophisticated science development and research. During this process, these young researchers have identified significant gaps which prevent start-ups and SME development. Among others, there is a lack of relevant data (databases) for research, lack of digital culture, lack of digital tools that support public and economic use of data gathered in medical sector and laboratories. Therefore, DMBIUBIH has launched the LabHub platform offering relevant stakeholders tools which resolve existing gaps.LabHub services1. Support to researchers and doctoral students in the field of biomedical research by enabling the use of unique databases for testing models and methodologies.2. Support for laboratories and healthcare institutions (SME and Midcaps) through free one-time use of eLab software for the analysis of their databases.3.

In the last decade, it has gained a relevant experience in the integration of innovative activities of large companies, SMEs, private research centres as well as Universities and public research centres for the development of mechatronics enabling technologies and their technological transfer to the territory.Mechatronics, born from the operational opportunity of integrating the multidisciplinary technologies of mechanics and electronics, continues creating integration opportunities of rapidly changing and multidisciplinary technologies. According to this, MEDISDIH continues to be strongly involved in the promotion of industrial product/process innovations integrating the recently achieved digital progress in order to support mechatronics technologies.MEDISDIH, by identifying I4.0 digital technologies as the key milestones for an effective industrial processes transformation to address the new territorial competitiveness needs, works to promote:I4.0 company organization based on digital tools for sharing information and supporting decisions;An evolved value chains concept of relationships between Dealers, OEMs and Tiers made possible by the new tools for sharing information between partner companies at different stages of the production process;New generation of products and services made possible by the high content of information of current products and their related components.Beside supporting the transfer of digital technologies to companies at any level of digital maturity, MEDISDIH is focussed on actively involving the relevant territorial actors in the main European, National and Regional digital innovation initiatives with particular reference to mechatronic and digital key enabling technologies for Robotics, Manufacturing, Health, Agri-food, Infrastructure and Security applications.The ChallengeMEDISDIH challenge is to implement knowledge and experience gained in the framework of projects coordinated by the Mechatronic Cluster (which have led to the digitalization of the production processes of several technologically advanced partner companies able to oversee global markets) in supporting manufacturing companies belonging to other industrial fields relevant for the territory, such as those of wood-furniture, footwear, clothing, the agro-food industry but also those of buildings and stone materials and coatings, etc., in operating a gradual digital transition at their measure.Doing so, MEDISDIH will also benefit from the experience gained in relationship with its Large Group member companies, which today delegate an ever-increasing number of activities to SMEs having a more effective business dimension to manage the development of specific high-tech product subsystems.This represents an important opportunity for local SMEs in terms of raising their products added value as well as their competitiveness. For this reason MEDISDIH intends to continue playing its role of intermediary between Apulian companies and large Industrial Groups, while sharing its decennial experience in the field of industrial processes and corporate organization gained from interactions with its Large Companies associated.In the process of supporting the transition of local SMEs to highly digitized industrial processes and company organization, MEDISDIH aims at maximize also the contribution of its Public Research Bodies partners as well as National Competence Centres to ensure that the digital innovations implemented by the companies of the territory could have the gaze already turned to those of the near future.Activities/Services of MEDISDIHIn line with the European strategy Digitizing European Industry, also adopted by Italian association Confindustria, MEDISDIH carries out its Digital Innovation Hub activities aimed at providing local companies with the following services to support the digitalisation of their own processes.Evaluation of digital maturityDevelopment of the innovation ecosystemMarket intelligenceTraining and educationSupporting SMEs in the analysis of needs, opportunities and I4.0 technological optionsBrokerageAccess to the specializations of Digital Competence Centres and technology clustersSupport in conceiving and planning Industry 4.0 projectsAccess to public and private, national and European projects and fundingIncubation and mentoring servicesConsulting on Industry 4.0 (intellectual property, tax, business modelling, evaluationof investment projectsMEDISDIH membersMEDISDIH is a no profit organization constituted in the form of a limited liability consortium company between public and private partners able to comprehensively represent the Apulian innovation ecosystem.

We actively participate in the work on standarization of ICT security and on development of biometric technologies.As an answer for EU Cybersecurity Act, NASK is also involved in a process of building ecosystem for cybersecurity certification (CertiSecPL initiative) - which is based among others on mentioned above KSO3 project experience.NASK carries out strategic projects for Polish public institutions in cooperation with central administration, research institutes and companies. For example we provide support and currently work on many innovative systems for public administration eg. EZD RP- electronic management of documents for government administration, mDokumenty - document verifying system stored on mobile phone.Among others, the Internet of Things as well as Artificial Intelligence are the emerging issues undertaken by NASK. NASK for last two years conducted the project dedicated to safety and security challenges coming together with IoT technology with a special focus on smart connected toys. NASK Social Research Laboratory applies two simultaneous approaches toward the issue. First, by analyzing AI-related trends in the Polish economy and among business communities secondly, by studying general publics attitude towards the AI revolution.One of the top initiatives of NASK as the Centre of Competences in fields of the digital technologies is the SECURE Conference with the longest tradition in Poland (launched in 1997) and the broadest approach to the ICT security issues.In 2016 NASK together with Ministry of Digital Affairs and two other national research institutes: National Institute of Telecommunication and Institute of Innovative Technologies created Scientific and Industrial ICT Center (CNPT). The aim of the CNPT is to coordinate the activities and building cooperation in area of R&amp;D result implementation, development of research infrastructure, implementation of internship programs for employees, as well as joint acquisition and service of domestic and European research projects.According to the Action Plan of the Ministry of Digitalization for Artificial Intelligence, the group of NASK research institute has been indicated as the Digital Hub of Innovation for AI in Poland. Together with Ministry for Digital Affairs and daughter companies (eg. NASK4Innovation), we are facilitating the uptake of Artificial Intelligence in Poland,, which we believe will be equally revolutionary with the potential to change the world, improve the quality of life and bring economic profits.

Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need to increase their business development expertise and capabilities in the field of digital health. Health care providers need to speed up their adoption of digital innovations and assess the impact of digital solutions on healthcare processes. New collaborative action models at the European level will speed up this development and knowledge building.OuluHealth is one of the leading digital health innovation ecosystems in Europe. Members of the OuluHealth ecosystem represent the whole spectrum of health and social care, including specialised medical care, primary health and social care, health and wellbeing industry and commerce, health technology research and education, and citizens.The main stakeholders of OuluHealth are Oulu University Hospital (OYS), University of Oulu, Oulu University of Applied Sciences, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, and BusinessOulu and the Department of Healthcare and Social Welfare of the City of Oulu. The OuluHealth ecosystem also encompasses more than 600 health and life science companies, at least 240 of which are high-tech companies (http://ouluhealth.fi/companies/ ). The ecosystem approach enables the combination of a broad range of expertise, from wireless information technologies and the life sciences to smart information and communication technology (ICT) solutions for delivering advanced, personalised, connected health service solutions. OuluHealth has close and tangible co-operation with SuperIOT, 5G test network Finland and Printocent Digital Innovation Hubs (DIH). Good example of this co-operation is for instance OYS to be the first hospital to test 5G-technology. The principal idea of OuluHealth is to facilitate open collaboration and to accelerate innovation by bringing together various partners to contribute to the needs of the healthcare sector and business growth in the modern digital era. This collaboration model promotes economic growth, capacity building and research and development and innovation (R&amp;D&amp;I) investments in select focus areas.The recently established DigiHealth Knowledge Hub will connect companies to the latest knowledge, expertise and technology. The Hub is speeding up the adoption of digital innovation and building a joint national network for digital health research and innovation. The DigiHealth Knowledge Hub is integrated nationally and internationally with the health sectors growth strategy implementation actions, RDI programmes and EU-level thematic platforms.The OuluHealth ecosystem supports companies in developing their ideas into market-ready products and services by providing support in activities such as identifying opportunities for digitalisation, bringing together relevant stakeholders, providing testing and piloting platforms and environments, offering services for growth and internationalisation, and hands-on training.Opportunities for collaborative research and innovation: OuluHealth supports companies, researchers and healthcare professionals to collaborate on research and innovation. The ecosystem model facilitates innovation platforms for multi-stakeholder development projects and startups within digital health. It creates synergies with international research and innovation networks and builds up new partnerships to highlight trends and gaps in policies in the arena of person-centred digital health.Innovative testing and piloting environments: OuluHealth provides a world-class development and testing environment, OuluHealth Labs, for testing innovations throughout the entire service chain: hospitals and health and social centres as well as in patients homes. In this way, companies have a unique opportunity to develop their solutions under authentic conditions and receive valuable feedback from healthcare professionals and end-users.Digital integration platform: OuluHealth Labs provides an open sandbox for developers to simulate the integration of digital technologies in hospital environments and simulate the change opportunities embedded in the digital process for health providers.Business development: OuluHealth offers health and life science companies tailor-made business development support, which includes financing and business modelling, internationalisation, media contacts and invest-In services. The ecosystem helps to find investors and the right partners, increase visibility and reach international markets.Knowledge building and support (DigiHealth Knowledge Hub): OuluHealth offers access to expert services and innovation networks to explore and exploit emerging technologies (AI, deep learning, big data analytics, etc.) in the next-generation digital solutions develops new assessment methods for digital healthcare solutions. OuluHealth shares best practices in the implementation of digital technologies and developing data-intensive service solutions and personalised health and care. OuluHealth is building innovation networking opportunities regionally, nationally and in EU thematic platformsMatchmaking: OuluHealth organises events such as the ecosystem and demo days to support the growth and needs of the market. It understands the needs and challenges of companies, provides information about novel digital solutions for health and social care professionals, and provides new knowledge and research to support digital transformation.Training events: OuluHealth and the Faculty of Medicine from the University of Oulu together with the Finnish Medical Association and industry organise education and training events for students, where they can learn to efficiently use new digital systems in their future work as well as test and evaluate health IT solutions. Moreover, by participating, eHealth companies get a chance to obtain first-hand feedback from 5th-level medical students.Innovation networks of OuluHealthThe OuluHealth ecosystem has active partnerships with researchers, business networks, and regional, national and international networks and alliances.On the EU level, OuluHealth is a member of the European Connected Health Alliance, EU COST-Action network: European Network for the Joint Evaluation of Connected Health Technologies (ENJECT) and Digital Health Society Task Forces, which are building EU-level strategies and proposing actions (Action plan 2018) in digital health. The City of Oulu has been granted EIP-AHA reference site status. Oulus evidence for status as a reference site is largely based on the OuluHealth ecosystem and its OuluHealth Labs operation. OuluHealth is an active member of the Nordic reference site collaboration with EIP-AHA. Furthermore, OuluHealth has applied to host the EU mHealth Hub and the bid has passed the first evaluation stage.By building a network of Nordic collaborators, OuluHealth aims to strengthen cooperation at both the strategic and operational levels. A good example of this is the network of Nordic Test Beds (NoTeB). Long collaboration with Nordic partners generated the Nordic Proof testing collaboration network, which OuluHealth will be a member of beginning in 2019. These active interactions with European innovation networks ensure the formation of strong strategic partnerships, as well as rapid and broad implementation of novel solutions and action models in innovation ecosystems.On the regional level, OuluHealth has strong collaborations with Allied ICT Finland, which brings together several domain-specific DIHs, such as Super IOT, PrintoCent, Arctic Drone Labs and 5G test network Finland as well as services like Analytics+ in Finland. OuluHealth is one of the five innovation ecosystems of the Oulu Innovation Alliance (OIA), which is a regional strategic collaboration model with committed stakeholders. The collaboration model has proven to be an excellent ecosystem model for public-private-people partnership cooperation at the regional, national and international level. OIAs four other ecosystems are Agile Commercialisation, ICT &amp; Digitalisation, Industry 2026, and Northern City with Attractive Opportunities.More info: www.ouluhealth.fi"},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Aapistie 5","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Finland","addressLocality":"Oulu"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Maritta","surname":"Perl-Heape","email":"Maritta.Perala-Heape@oulu.fi","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Education","Life sciences & healthcare"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:5604","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Parque Tecnolgico de Andaluca (PTA)"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://www.pta.es/es/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"MISSIONParque Tecnolgico de Andaluca (PTA) is a place where national and international companies, entrepreneurs, technology centers and university research groups all come together and generate highly innovative products and services for the global market.SCOPEParque Tecnolgico de Andaluca (PTA) has been specially designed to house all types of entities dealing with innovation.

We believe that a fragmented approach to building the multi-billion Photonics business in Europe is never going to scale. Disruptive innovation needed to keep Europes lead in integrated photonics starts when young companies get access to the knowledge already gained by high-tech enterprises and applied research institutes. Although private initiatives are starting to grow, public funding is still needed to bridge the gap between working prototypes leaving the research lab and the point at which the chips are ready to be manufactured in quantity. Its at that point where the private sector takes over. Grant funding to support research and innovation in SMEs has grown tenfold in the last decade to reach 100 million a year. But we believe that in order to keep a lead ahead of the US and Asia, funding level should be 10-20 times that. PhotonDelta is taking the lead to coordinate activities amongst other European digital innovation hubs working in optics and other sectors where photonics is a key enabling technology. So, for example, PhotonDelta is focusing on integrated photonics around SiN and InP. Were collaborating with Irelands IPIC who are championing the challenges of photonics packaging, and participate in the ACTPHAST initiative recognized by the EC as an example of a Digital Innovation Hub; it provides open access for SMEs to design and manufacturing facilities in Integrated Photonics. We are establishing three pillars under PhotonDelta: PhotonDelta Research The Institute of Photonic Integration builds on 40 years of optics research at TU/e  in cooperation with other nanotechnology centres like Mesa+ at the University of Twente and Saxion University of Applied Sciences.  PhotonDelta Cooperative - a consortium of scale-ups, manufacturers and investors. The goal is to build win-win situations for members, including early access to Research IP. The Photonics Integration technology centre (PITC) is currently being established, branching out on Europe-wide work done in circuits and components by the JePPIX consortium and the systems work done by the 5GBluespace Projects. Domains on pilot production lines, packaging, prototyping, building block development, and testing are currently being developed. PhotonDelta is very pro-active in outreach to industry, government and research organisations.

PIAP acknowledges the low level of digitalisation in Polish manufacturing companies relative to other European countries and wants to facilitate the upcoming boom in this field in the Mazovian Region and in the whole country. Nowadays PIAP helps companies in the region become more competitive by improving their business/production processes as well as products (and services) by means of digital technology. This is being achieved by offered support with expertise and infrastructure, consulting and training services.PIAPs established role of competence centre for robotics, automation and measurements for industrial purposes has been accompanied by a number of services based on the expertise such as technology audits, technology scouting and technology brokering. By runnig a Hub in Warsaw PIAP intends to extend its impact to the SME sector by offering services to companies which currently have a relatively low level of digitisation and which do not have the resources or personnel to address the digitisation challenge.The hub has access to a number of labs used for scientific and commercial purposes. These are being integrated in processes supporting business in order introduce the one-stop-shop principle. Our goal is to have the capacity to offer companies possibilities to test and experiment with technologies. To support the technology providers and users to carry out an experiment and to test whether the proposed approach would indeed be beneficial for the user. At the same time this experiment can be useful for the provider that has an early customer and can adapt the technology to the needs of a certain class of users.Technologies developed by PIAP, its partners and clients may take advantage of PIAPs commercialization good practices offered in the form of supporting service. Upon request they will be subject to commercialization potential evaluation by PIAP special purpose vehicle PIAP-Scientech Sp. z o.o.. The methodology developed in cooperation with an SPV of the Warsaw University of Technology will be applied. If the technologies show potential of commercialization, the process will be launched and the success fee will be distributed among parties involved in commercialization and R&amp;D. Several networks and organizations (National Chamber o Commerce, Polish Institute of Technology, VCs and intermediaries running investment opportunities scans) will be involved in the process. Playing the role core partner in PIAP HUB Fundingbox Accelerator Sp. z o.o. provide access to cascade funding, acceleration andincubation programs and cascade funding distribution.The role of the animator of the hub will be not only to offer its expertise and resources but most of all to integrate the potential of the whole ecosystem of public and private labs, technology and service providers.

Like many other influential metropolitan areas in Europe, it suffered from a de-industrialization and trade shrinking consequences. As a result, many wholesale companies were closed and unemployment rate started to progress.At this end, the Municipality of Piraeus is deploying a comprehensive strategy in order to meet the challenges that the city faces due to the rapid changes of the last years, as well as the opportunities that are opening up in the coming years. This strategy is based on a long-term planning aiming to combine effectively a dynamic business environment with the concern for business development and new job creation in competitive and innovative sectors of the Blue Economy.Piraeus Blue Growth Digital Innovation Hub (BG-DIH) goal is to inspire and help young entrepreneurs to realize innovative business concepts relating to marine and freshwater resources. It promotes creative disruption in the maritime sector and introduces promising business opportunities, create new jobs, and transform traditional processes into more productive and sustainable activities. In other words, BG-DIH hosts an umbrella of actions to promote business ideas relating to the sea and aquatic resources through a range of environmental, economic and social responsibility initiatives.BG-DIH is a regional multi-partner cooperation (including organizations like research and technology organizations, universities, industry associations, chambers of commerce, incubator/accelerators, local and regional development agencies, etc.) serving as one stop-shop that helps Blue Economy companies to become more competitive with regard to their business/production processes, products or services using digital technologies.In this context, BG-DIH will soon include a technologically advanced hosting and demonstration space (Key enabling technology) for acquainting and familiarizing the local population with new technologies and their capabilities. More specifically, the exploitation of advanced technological equipment (3D Printing manufacturing technology etc.), under the guidance of properly educated consulting staff, promotes experimentation and creation of new innovative products and services. At the same time, it will also be shortly able to provide business support to implement these innovations across the value chain. Another block of actions is relevant to the development of skills and knowledge of human capital, in order for Piraeus companies to maintain access to a highly ICT skilled workforce and to enable the labor force to acquire new knowledge regarding the Blue Economy and the new technologies sectors.Organisational form of BG-DIHBG-DIH is a nonprofit institution.

Typically these regions have strong SME and agricultural profile and many local success stories, which deserve to be highlighted. Too often, however, these entrepreneurs lack public interest, technological awareness, capital and workforce. They deserve up-to-date services for testing, good opportunities for project networks and supportive consultancy services for marketing, personnel training and productization.Rural Industry DIH aims at filling this gap, focusing on activities that help surrounding rural areas to grow according to their full potential. Digitalization of businesses is the core of activities, realized in research &amp; innovation, education &amp; training, technical consultation &amp; support, internationalization, novel business models and funding. The actions of Rural Industry DIH are in line with the regional Smart Specialization Strategies, supporting the innovation potential of SMEs in the digital transformation. Oulu Regions smart specialization strategy recognizes the digitalization as a cross-cutting theme in the support of the chosen spearhead industries. The strategy will be updated in 2020, recognizing better the importance of the development of rural industries, like agriculture and food industry and the responding actions to the climate change.The digitalization challenges in the area have been identified, and DIH activities are having strong focus on them right from the beginning:Companies having low digitalization level in current situation and not enough skills and resources to ramp it up alone. Especially SMEs with longer history and more aged leadership are typical cases of this kind. These companies will be helped by training and getting them aqcuainted with possibilities of digital modernization. Laboratories available added with feasibility studies gained in various projects and customer cases are a good help forCompanies needing help for more digital / Industry4.0 enhancements in their processes and products. In particular, there are a lot of SME manufacturing companies in the DIH region, which are lacking the needed expertize for next steps. Often there are punctual needs related to testing, analysis, robotization, new sensor solutions, IoT etc. DIH main actors have strong experience in this area and can provide test-before-invest activities in modern digital manufacturing enviroments in their labs, to help them go through demanding design phases, provide fast prototyping and POC services etc.Companies needing help for their internal working processes such as e-commerce, agile working methods, quality raising, smart logistics, product information models and other new enhancements typical for the new digital age. Typically these include both working processes and supporting IT systems, both of which must be taken under active development. Many times these companies would be able to provide B2B products and services also in a globalized manner, but they need help for raising the needed skills and digital systems.Helping tools include not only training and consultation, but also networking and internationalization, in close connection with the previous system development processes.Rural Industry DIH works in 3 neighboring NUTS3 regions, Oulu Region, Central Ostrobothnia and Ostrobothnia. The administrational center of Rural Industry DIH is located in Ylivieska campus in Oulu Region. The ecosystem consists of all administrational key actors of the area. The regional councils of all the three regions are committed to support Rural Industry DIH as well as ELY Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (representing Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland). In addition, all the local sub-regional development agencies are included in the co-operational network.All three regional competence centers are committed to operate DIH daily work.Centria University of Applied Sciences acts as a leading partner of the Rural Industry DIH. Besides of having higher education in 3 campuses in the area, it&#39;s R&amp;D division has a long record in research projects, having typically running 80 projects with about 6M annual budget. Centria has also over 30 years of nationally acclaimed experience in co-operation with rural companies, providing testing, prototyping and consultation services in different business areas with annual volume of 1,5M. From over 100 people working for Centria R&amp;D, over 40 are solely dedicated to digitalization themes and serving Rural Industry DIH with all their professional ambition.The University of Oulu Kerttu Saalasti Institute is an international research institute with a mission to provide evidence based knowledge on micro-enterprises and their operating conditions. Our research theme is Operational Excellence of Micro-Enterprises. Kerttu Saalasti Instituute provides knowledge from the prespectives of Micro-Entrepreneurship as well as Future Manufacturing Technologies and Regional Excellence that enable vitality and growth at the micro-enterprise level. Societal impact of research is our strength. Kerttu Saalasti Institute provides knowledge to support development of enterprises and communities in order to generate sustainable growth.Kokkola University Consortium Chydenius acts as a joint institution in Kokkola, carrying out teaching and research under the auspices of the universities of Jyvskyl, Oulu and Vaasa.. The Consortiums areas of specialization mainly reflect those of its university partners: education, data processing, social sciences and regional studies, business and administration, natural sciences, and materials technology. The University Consortium offers both masters and doctoral level education. In addition, it engages in scientific research, arranges a wide range of adult education courses, and accepts commissions from individuals and organizations within the region. Thus, its activities may be looked on as a modern attempt to combine the goals of educational, scientific, and regional policy under one roof.These 3 competence centers share the responsibility of operational activities. All of them are non-profit academic institutions, and the aim of DIH is strictly non-commercial. Consortium behind these three main actors is composed of a comprehensive selection of regional economic development agencies, chambers of commerce, SME service organizations and companies. Together they form a substantial overall capability for strong regional impact. Commercial consortium members having profit organization status are not responsible of any operational work, as they have more a mentor-type role, also representing other commercial SME and MidCap field in the area. That way the needs and challenges of companies will be heard better in Rural Industry DIH.In addition, the plan is to bind the new Rural Industry DIH immediately to the existing participation / collaboration networks of DIHs such as 5GTNF, Smart Manufacturing DIH and ROBOCOAST. Moreover, the dense ecosystem of international co-operation via S3 Agrifood, ERIAFF, ERRIN, European Industry associations and project consortiums are utilized in order to establish firm European-wide collaboration environment."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Vierimaantie 7","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Finland","addressLocality":"Ylivieska"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Mikko","surname":"Himanka","email":"mikko.himanka@centria.fi","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Mining and quarrying","Energy and utilities","Construction","Transport and logistics","Public administration","Education","Life sciences & healthcare","Community, social and personal service activities","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of wood and wood products","Manufacture of chemicals, chemical products and man-made fibres","Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products","Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal products","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:1292","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Safe Cluster"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://www.safecluster.com/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"SAFE Cluster is a recent created cluster focusing onglobal security*.

However, it is not easy to link ICT systems between companies, especially covering the supply network as-a-whole. Current practice shows that many companies solve this manually: Employees transfer information from an incoming order into their own system. SCSN is a communication standard enabling the machine building industry to share data across company borders in an easier, safer, and more reliable way.Manual data management is prone to errorsThe Dutch industryfocuses specifically on the so-called low volume and high mix, high complexity machine building industry. The success of the supply chains in this industry increasingly depends on sharing large amounts of data across company borders.Especially for SMEs that have a central role in these supply chains, receiving and sending data is not automated. This means that data received from their customers must be read, interpreted, and usually entered manually in their own ERP system. This often takes a lot of time and is prone to errors.SCSN enables the automatic flow and processing of data. There are also strict agreements about the semantics of the messages, so that there is only one way to interpret them.SCSN solves thedisadvantages of EDI and cloud servicesNowadays, a lot of data is exchanged between two companies via an EDI link. If a company wants to exchange data with a new partner, it will have to set up a new EDI connection. This is not necessary with SCSN. Companies must register once with an SCSN Service Provider and can exchange data with all other affiliated companies in the production chain, such as orders, invoices, technical product data, etc. It is therefore not necessary to connect to each company separately.Using cloud connections to exchange data in between companies often means that data is stored outside the company and becomes visible to the cloud service provider. With SCSN, a company keeps a grip on its own data; it determines which data is shared with whom. The use of SCSN results in higher productivity of the supply chain through fast, secure, and interoperable exchange of information between companies.Finally, this community of service providers and manufacturing companies is managed by the not-for-profit Foundation Smart Connected Supplier Network. This foundation is chairing the community and managing the SCSN-standard, which is published as open source standard. The Foundation SCSN is supervised by an elected Supervisory Board consisting of two manufacturing companies, service providers, sector organizations, and knowledge providers.Benefits of SCSNConnect once, communicate with the entire supply chain.SCSN works for the OEM, 1st, 2ndand 3rdsuppliers, wholesalers and steel producers and works with most available ERP software.Manufacturing companies in control over their own data all the time.Managed by an open source community chaired by a not-for-profit foundation."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"BIC 1","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Netherlands","addressLocality":"Eindhoven"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"de","surname":"Roode","email":"mike.deroode@tno.nl","role":"Mike","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Wholesale and retail","Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal products","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Other Manufacturing"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:1446","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Smart Data Innovation Lab"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://www.sdil.de/en/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"The Smart Data Innovation Lab (SDIL) offers big data researchers unique access to a large variety of big data and in-memory technologies.

In the same way, the integration of productive systems with energy generation systems, following circular economy models, is key for the translation of productive projects to countries with low quality of energy supply.Technological solutions: new sources of energy, monitoring of energy expenditure, power electronics, energy storage, distributed energy models, are some examples of specific technical challenges that are included in this field. Internet of Things(e.g. connected devices, sensors and actuators networks). Robotics and autonomous systems.High Perfortmance Computing (HPC)Ecology Challenge (Environmental): the environment is considered by the current economists as the fourth factor of production. Consciousness of the limit in the use of resources supposes a restriction, more and more generalized, to industrial development and that changes the paradigm of productivity, typical of an oil-based economy, by a new paradigm, that of sustainability, owner of a new economic model that looks for renewable sources and that tries to optimize the biological and biotechnological processes for industrial uses. At present, the lack of productivity of biological resources and processes is the main challenge facing science and technology, leading to a progressive process of transition from an economy of fossil sources to a bio-economy.Traceability, the reduction of distribution chains and the reduction of transport needs and, above all, the hybridization between computer and electronic technologies with the life sciences, giving rise to so-called &#34;omics&#34; as enabling technologies Key (KETs, by its abbreviations in English, Key Enabling Technologies) that will probably provide the main disruptive innovations of the next years, are challenges and technological domains that must be present in the offer of services of the Hub.Technological solutions: Technologies for efficiency in agriculture (high precision farming, drones or UAVs, irrigation systems by telemetry, automatized meteorological stations); technologies forefficiency in livestock etc..Equality Challenge : the concept of equality, or equity, refers to the social dimension of economic activity, and is a gap that is becoming increasingly large between the North and the South, even within the developed societies, giving rise to some of the most pressing problems, such as migration processes, or demographic imbalances. The development of products for the Base of the Pyramid, that is, for that large percentage of the population that lives on less than two dollars a day, integrated solutions for the socio-economic development of the communities, or the use of technology with a source of rights , and services that improve the quality of life of the population, as well as the improvement of productive processes that facilitate the reconciliation of personal and professional life or skilled work from rural areas, are challenges to which digitization can contribute.Technological solutions : Platform for responsible production and consumption; technologies for distribution and sales; technologies to improve health; work flexibility, teleworking and e-learning; robotic assistance systemsEconomy Challenge : in the sense of &#34;economy class&#34; or &#34;low cost&#34; are tendencies that require efforts of efficiency in the use of resources, or in the redesign of processes so that competitiveness does not depend on the low cost of labour or environmentally unsustainable processes. European industry faces these market trends, and competition from countries with lower quality, environmental or labor standards; one option is to leave these market segments, but without them it will be difficult to converge with 20% of industrial GDP, the reindustrialization of Europe also means making companies that operate in traditional sectors where prices make a difference competitive, without the best alternative being the delocalisation of production and the focus on services, both design and development and marketing, because these activities are also less inclusive in terms of employment than productive activities.Technological solutions Process reengineering, lean manufacturing, industry 4.0. applied to value chains, the reduction of intermediaries, the robotization of processes, the generation of large economies of scale through industrial symbiosis, competitive intelligence are some of the keys to improving efficiency in business processes that facilitate competitiveness in markets with reduced margins.Industrial robots; automatized warehouses and inventory management systems;digital manufacturing techniques, new manufacturing processes; lean manufacturing, energy saving systems in industry; energy storage systems; hybrid and electric vehicles;new materials; virtual and augmented reality"},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Avenida de la Investigacin, s/n.  06006 Badajoz","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Spain","addressLocality":"Badajoz"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Anto","surname":"Recio","email":"info@dih4e.eu","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Energy and utilities","Transport and logistics","Public administration","Education","Life sciences & healthcare","Community, social and personal service activities","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of wood and wood products","Other Manufacturing"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:18416","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"TECHNOLOGIKO PANEPISTIMIO KYPROU"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":""},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":""},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"45 Kitiou Kyprianou Str.,","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Cyprus","addressLocality":"Limassol"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Savvas","surname":"LOIZOU","email":"savvas.loizou@cut.ac.cy","role":"","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":[]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:1369","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Technology Park doo (SEEUTechPark)"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://techpark.seeu.edu.mk/"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"SEEUTechPark is a technology park located on South East European University campus in Tetovo, Macedonia.

With a special focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, the pilot financially supported 50 actual transfer experiments throughout Europe and helped to generate a multitude of new jobs, new products and new businesses. Based on its highly recognized success TETRACOM has evolved into TETRAMAX, operating at much larger scale and with even higher ambitions (https://www.tetramax.eu). It is primary aiming to provide the implementation of the European Smart Anything Everywhere (SAE) initiative in the domain of customized low energy computing (CLEC) for CPS and the IoT. The initiative builds on three major activity lines: (1) Stimulating, organizing, co-funding, and evaluating different types of cross-border Application Experiments, providing EU added value via innovative CLEC technologies to first-time users and broad markets in European ICT-related industries, (2) Building and leveraging a new European CLEC competence center network, offering technology brokerage, one-stop shop assistance and CLEC training to SMEs and mid-caps, and with a clear evolution path towards new regional digital innovation hubs where needed, and (3) Paving the way towards self-sustainability based on pragmatic and customized long-term business plans. The project impact will be measured based on well-defined, goal-oriented performance indicators. The immediate ambition of TETRAMAX within its duration is to support 50+ industry clients and 3rd parties in the entire EU with innovative technologies, leading to an estimated revenue increase of 25 Mio.  based on 50+ new or improved CLEC-based products, 10+ entirely new businesses/SMEs initiated, as well as 30+ new permanent jobs and significant cost and energy savings in product manufacturing. Moreover, in the long term, TETRAMAX will be the trailblazer towards a reinforced, profitable, and sustainable ecosystem infrastructure, providing CLEC competence, services (https://www.tetramax.eu/the-project/) and a continuous innovation stream at European scale, yet with strong regional presence as preferred by SMEs."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Templergraben 55","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Germany","addressLocality":"Aachen"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Rainer","surname":"Leupers","email":"leupers@ice.rwth-aachen.de","role":"Dr.","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Energy and utilities","Transport and logistics","Public administration","Education","Life sciences & healthcare","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Manufacture of transport equipment","Other Manufacturing"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:1357","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Technoport SA"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"http://technoport.lu/online/www/function/aboutus/967/ENG/index.html"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"Technoport ltd. has been set-up back in June 2012 as the result of the merge between the former Technoport, a technology-oriented business incubator launched by the Public Research Center Henri Tudor back in 1998, and Ecostart I and II, business support infrastructures developed since 2004 by the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade.The global mission of Technoport is to help and support individuals and small teams to validate and bridge their ideas to success through three platforms:THE TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INCUBATOR:this activity is the core business of Technoport.

Main focus will be digitalization for healthy and ecological tourism, cycling routes, cultural tourism;Smart Cities: Information management and management technology, computing and imaging; Production of solar panels; Urban Mobility Plans; Waste management plans;Wood Processing &amp; Furniture: Production&amp; Implementation of assistive technologies for production processes, quality &amp; design;Green energy;Heritage conservation and development.For these areas the center has developed ability to offer services to the region in engineering, GIS application, engineering in precision agriculture, industry 4.0 in furniture manufacturing and other industries and green energies, engineering in logistic digitalization.We are able also to offer the best expertise and skills in technologies needed for digital transformation, such as:data processing, IoT, Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, cloud computing, laser technologies, blockchain, systems of spatial or geographical information and others.Targets and services for regional clientsOur hub is well connected to the Danube region and is an active partner in the macro-regional context of the Danube Strategy. Therefore, we will harmonize our services and targets not only in the national or European context, but also in the macro-regional context, South-Muntenia region being bordered at the south by the Danube River.DIH will focus on:SMEs in the South Muntenia region - South Muntenia region has a low density of SMEs and even a smaller number of innovative ones. Therefore, we target both start-ups and start-ups services which can focus on innovative digitalization and SMEs able to scaleup their business in smart specialisation already mentioned above. At the same group are targeted cluster managers which can act as brokers to reach the companies inside their clusters.Researchers and innovators, including individuals, young PhD students, academics, students, Start-uppers, SMEs, and industry playersactively engaged in research and innovationinitiatives that are of direct relevance to define, strengthen and shape the R&amp;D agenda for the DIH and grow the DIH ecosystem.Local authorities, Public Administrationbodies, Policymakers: the various public and private authorities and policymakers committed to the DIH by supporting the development of its initiatives, fostering research, development and innovation that shall have a positive impact for the regional/ national society.Regional, national and EU representatives and entities, involved in DIHs assessment and evaluation  to be further identified and defined this segment.For these groups we will design packages of services adapted to each of them which will include the followingTraining, awareness and transfer of knowledge regarding digital transformation and digital technologies. We will bring together digital social innovators, universities and civil societyincluding the broad media, citizens, students, researchers, social entrepreneurs, NGOs and smart cities representatives that could benefit from an open R&amp;D&amp;I ecosystem creating opportunities for individuals and/or associations through more direct access to the DIH instruments and opportunities.Matching the needs with the local and international offer in the area of digitalisation, technology providers/ developers/ large companies.Start-up, scale-up and acceleration.Networking activities, workshops for digitization in collaboration with other sectors.Hackathons.Internationalization services.Wallachia eHub Consortium includes also a series of regional and national partners organisations, such as:Regional Development Agency South-Muntenia, Petroleum-Gas University of Ploieti,Valahia University of Targoviste, Ploiesti SMEs Patronage,ARIES - Romanian Association for Electronics and Software, Chamber of Commerce and Industry Prahova, Agency for SMEs, Attracting Investments and Promoting Exports from Ploiesti etc."},"address":{"type":"Property","value":{"streetAddress":"Strada Alexandru Vlahuta nr. 24","addressRegion":"","postalCode":"","addressCountry":"Romania","addressLocality":"Ploiesti"}},"representatives":{"type":"Property","value":[{"name":"Irina","surname":"Gabriela","email":"iri_radulescu@yahoo.com","role":"Radulescu","responsibilities":""}]},"domain":{"type":"Property","value":["Agriculture and food","Energy and utilities","Construction","Tourism (incl. restaurants and hospitality)","Transport and logistics","Public administration","Education","Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco","Manufacture of wood and wood products","Manufacture of machinery and equipment","Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment","Manufacture of transport equipment"]},"competences":{"type":"Property","value":[""]},"socialAccounts":{"type":"Property","value":{"linkedin":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","instagram":""}},"relation":{"type":"Property","value":[{"relationType":"dih","relationIdentifier":""},{"relationType":"service","relationIdentifier":""}]},"@context":["https://schema.lab.fiware.org/ld/context","https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld"]},{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:DigitalInnovationHub:s3jrc:12683","type":"DigitalInnovationHub","title":{"type":"Property","value":"Web Science Institute"},"website":{"type":"Property","value":"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/wsi"},"logo":{"type":"Property","value":{"base64Data":"","fileName":""}},"description":{"type":"Property","value":"The Web Science Institute is an entrepreneurial non-profit research institute within the University of Southampton.It coordinates the University of Southamptons globally recognised expertise on the development and social impact of Web technologies, offering analysis, tools, data and advice to government, business and civil society.
